RSA and AES are both encryption algorithms, but they differ in performance and use cases. RSA is an asymmetric algorithm that uses a public and private key pair, making it secure but relatively slow, especially for large amounts of data. It is typically used to encrypt small pieces of information, such as keys or digital signatures. AES, on the other hand, is a symmetric algorithm that uses the same key for encryption and decryption. It is very fast and efficient, making it suitable for encrypting large files or messages. In practice, many systems combine the two: RSA is used to securely exchange an AES key, and AES encrypts the actual data.
